# MB Calc

Lightweight macOS menu-bar calculator. The app stays in the status bar, opens a split-view editor for inputs and results, and now includes a right-click menu with Quit. Built using [rumps](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps), the Ridiculously Uncomplicated macOS Python Statusbar framework.
