# MB Calc

Lightweight macOS menu-bar calculator. The app stays in the status bar, opens a split-view editor for inputs and results, and now includes a right-click menu with Quit. Built on top of [RUMPS](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps), the Ridiculously Uncomplicated macOS Python Statusbar framework.

## Development

- Build bytecode: `python -m compileall src`
- Launch locally: `uv run mb-calc`
